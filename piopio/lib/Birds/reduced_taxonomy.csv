Struthio camelus,Common Ostrich,ostric2,Struthioniformes,Ostriches,Struthionidae,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v2/asset/204565301/1800,"Massive, conspicuous, flightless bird with long neck and robust legs. Mature males have black-and-white plumage, with pinkish skin, flushed in breeding plumage. Females and immatures are duller gray-brown. Small groups roam open and lightly-wooded country; can walk up to several kilometers a day. The stubby wings are used for spectacular breeding displays and dust-bathing. Deep booming calls can be heard from long distances. Similar Somali Ostrich (no range overlap) has slaty-colored skin and pale eyes, unlike the pink-skinned Common Ostrich."

Males have a blue-gray neck and legs, but the bill and front of the legs become pink when breeding. Females have dull pinkish-colored legs and neck. Found in a variety of dry habitats, including grassland, thornscrub, and semi-desert. Often in small groups. Very similar to Common Ostrich, but males separated by their blue legs and neck and the lack of a white ring at the base of the neck. Females are separated by their pale eyes. The voice is a deep, lion-like booming."

Unlikely to be confused with other species. Hatchlings are brown and strongly striped. Juvenile and Immature birds are similar to adults but browner and with an absent or developing head-plate. Found in dense tropical rainforest, where it can be seen crossing roads, or along roadsides."

Shaggy black plumage, blue head and bright red or yellow around the base of the neck. Large casque flattened at the back and a single wattle from the throat. A very shy and little-known species which, like other cassowaries, forages on the forest floor, mainly for fallen fruit. Similar to Southern Cassowary but Northern has single rather than double wattle, different-shaped casque and usually red or yellow all the way around the base of the throat."

Mostly nocturnal, with some day foraging observed on Stewart Island and certain locations in Fiordland. Restricted to the mountains near Haast, Fiordland, Stewart Island, and sanctuaries. Foraging produces clear audible sniffling. Males give a series of clear rising whistles while females give a harsh throaty wail. Both sexes repeat their call many times. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."

It is uniformly sooty gray, much darker and plainer than Gray Tinamou. Rusty lower underparts are hard to see in the field. Like other forest tinamous, it is far more likely to be heard than seen.

Winters on any open body of water where food is available. Extremely similar to Tundra Swan, but never shows yellow on bill. Also, note subtle features of face: facial skin is relatively broad where it meets eye, so the eye doesn't stand out, and border between white face and black bill is straight (curved on Tundra). From head-on, the border of the bill and forehead is usually pointed (straight or curved on Tundra). Often in pairs or family groups. Almost went extinct in early 20th century, but population has rebounded and been reintroduced to some areas."

Females are grayish-brown, often with a paler patch at the base of the bill and a white eyering. Both sexes have a white band near the tip of gray bill. Also note gray, not white, wingstripe in flight. Usually favors small bodies of water, such as beaver ponds and cattail marshes, but also occurs on larger lakes, rivers, and bays. Can be found in mixed flocks with other diving ducks, although usually in smaller numbers than scaup. Compare with both species of scaup and Redhead (especially females)."

Also note peaked crown and rather long gray bill. In flight, both sexes show bold white wing stripe. Compare with female Tufted Duck (can have similar white patch under tail). Inhabits lakes and marshes, usually with surrounding reeds. Rather shy and often stays hidden in reeds, but at other times out in open water with flocks of Tufted Duck and Common Pochard."

A large duck that is mostly rich brown, with white under the tail. Shows a conspicuous white wing stripe in flight. Males have a pale eye and females a dark one. Lives on freshwater lakes and wetlands. Dives frequently, like a grebe, but is much larger. Lacks the pale face of White-faced Whistling-Duck. Smaller than Meller’s Duck, with darker brown coloration and white under the tail."

Breeding male has a dark green gloss to the head, but often seems dark-headed in poor lighting. Non-breeding males are duller, but have pale eyes. Females and immatures have dark brown heads and dark eyes. Boldly patterned chestnut-and-white sides unique among ducks; compare the brown sides of Ferruginous Duck and pale sides of Common Pochards, both similar species. Can be difficult to separate from Ferruginous Duck, with which it sometimes hybridizes; note less extensive white wing panels in present species. During the colder months, often found singly or in small groups within non-breeding flocks of more common duck species. Breeds on sheltered, well-vegetated lakes; prefers large open bodies of water in the winter."

Boldly patterned male distinctive: black overall with bright white flanks (whiter than scaup) and floppy crest. Female dark brown overall with short crest, paler flanks, staring golden-yellow eyes, and often a messy white patch at base of bill. In flight, both sexes show bold white wingstripe. Often in flocks in winter; feeds mainly by diving, but often spends much of day sleeping. Widespread breeder across Eurasia, wintering to central Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Rare winter vagrant to North America, where almost always found singly among flocks of scaup. Compared with scaup, Tufted Duck always shows very dark blackish back, and even nearly tuftless females are darker than scaup with more limited white patch on face."

Widely but patchily distributed throughout North and South Islands; not found on Stewart Island, and no longer present on Chatham Islands. Unlike any other resident duck species. Compact and dark; floats on water with cork-like buoyancy, showing bath-toy duck silhouette. Forms large flocks, often congregating in sheltered areas near willows or reed beds. Spends a lot of time underwater, where it can travel considerable distances. Sexes alike but distinguishable. Male has dark black plumage, iridescent blue-green head and wings, and yellow iris. Female is duller brown with brown iris. Flies with very fast wingbeats, often just above the water’s surface. Vagrant Hardhead differs in its white iris, white undertail, and white “saddle” on bill."

Slightly more likely to be seen on smaller bodies of water, especially fresh water, than Greater Scaup, but much overlap. Frequently in mixed flocks with other Aythya ducks. Widespread across North America, with more southerly range extent than Greater Scaup, regularly reaching northern South America."
